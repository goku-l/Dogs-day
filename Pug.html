        Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs.
        The pug gets its name from the Latin word that means ‘clenched fist’, because of the flat nose.
        With their comical face and hilarious personalities, pugs are the jesters of the canine world.
        They do very well with children and other animals alike, especially if socialized from a young age
