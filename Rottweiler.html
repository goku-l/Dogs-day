    <p>
        The Rottweiler is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large or large.
        Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs, and police dogs.

    <p>
        Rotties have a natural instinct to protect their families and can be ferocious in their defense. 
        It's essential to channel their power and protectiveness by providing early socialization, firm,
        fair, consistent training and leadership, and a regular job to perform. When this doesn't happen,
        Rottweilers can become dangerous bullies rather than the companionable guardians they're meant to be.
